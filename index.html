        <p>My name is Aidan Altmann, and this is my online portfolio for all of my past and ongoing projects. </p>
        <p>I am graduating Northeastern University in May 2025 with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and Minor in Business Administration. </p>
        <p>Throughout this site, you'll be able to see my experiences with my own endeavors into robotics, electronics modification, and other side projects I've taken up, as well as my portfolio of film photography. </p>
        <p>As I continue to develop my skills as a mechanical engineer and amateur photographer, I'll update my progress here, so feel free to explore the different spaces here to see what I've been working on.  </p>
        <p>For any questions, please visit the Contact side of this page to find how best to reach me. </p>

   <h2>About me</h2>
        <!--Born and raised in New York City, early on in my life I took an interest in travel, martial arts, and more recently film photography. To this day, outside of my work in engineering, these three hobbies take up the most of my time. I have a strong base in boxing, but over the years have developed experience in kickboxing, Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, and hope to further expand my knowledge in more martial arts. -->
        <!--Learning from my older brother, I practice film photography, attempting to try different films and styles across the different locations I visit in my travels. My ultimate goals for myself are to compete in the combat sports I'm learning at the given time, to develop my photography skills, and to travel to new places arond the world and use the experiences I have there to better round out my approach towards engineering and design. -->
   
<p> Born and raised in New York City, I grew up fascinated with film photography, travel, and boxing. These interests continue today. In my free time, I'm often trying to improve the quality of the pictures I take, learning from my older brother, training boxing and other martial arts in purusit of competiton, and travelling wherever I can. I often travel on my own to not only find opportunities for the aforementioned interests, taking photos of the places I encounter, or training at martial arts schools I come across along the way, but more importantly to meet, learn from, and befriend people from all over and expand my perspective of the world as a whole. These interests have definitely played a role in my outlook towards my work. I find protective equipment fascinating, even having had a brief opportunity to work on a wrestling helmet in the past, largely from my background and experience with combat sports. Seeing how different places around the world design solutions for their population based on environment, convenience, and standards has also stayed with me when thinking of solutions to problems I come across today. Learning from some of the people I've met across my travels has also helped me find clarity on what it is I want my output into the world to be. Approaching graduation, my goal as an engineer is to work on projects that really benefit the people using it, and wanting my work to contribute towards solutions that leave the world better off because of it.  </p>
